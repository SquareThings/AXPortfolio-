        <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p class="header">
            Yan’s Cusine is a popular local restaurant near Brown University known for its quick and cheap takeout (a
            personal favorite). Students often order directly from the restaurant's website, however, new users often
            find it challenging to navigate. This project will perform a heuristic analysis of Yan Cusine’s landing page
            and navigation and propose a new layout to allow better customers to explore the measure and order their
            meals more efficiently

            <h2>WAVE Analysis</h2>
            <p class="header">
                In terms of accessibility, there is only one main error identified by the WAVE tool which is that the
                search button is lacking form labels, meaning those who are using certain accessibility devices may not
                be able to evaluate that specific element. In addition, another concern flagged by WAVE is the type size
                of all the dish categories, which are all presented on the webpage with fonts 10px or smaller and could
                make it difficult for hard-of-sight users to parse through the menu.

                    I first approached the challenge of redesigning this site with a low-fidelity wireframe across
                    desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. In particular, since the original website prioritized
                    online ordering and menu parsing, I expanded the menu. Additionally, since Yan’s is pick-up only,
                    other high-priority information would be not only the hours but also the location, which was
                    highlighted in a sidebar. Lastly, because in the original website, clicking into a category would
                    obscure other menu options, I opted to go with a horizontal tabbed menu for which there is a nested
                    vertical scroll page -therefore you can both maintain your categorical location in the menu while
                    also looking at specific items.

                <p class="boxes2">
                    While creating this design system, I tried to consider all the potential button/background states
                    and organized them into components. In addition, I used Figma plug-ins to check WCAG3 compliance.

                        Throughout the process of building the hi-fi prototype, I also annotated the page with
