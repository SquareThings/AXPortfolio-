            <section>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                UX Designer/Front-end Developer
                <br>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                Yan’s Cuisine is a popular local restaurant near Brown University known for its quick and cheap takeout
                (a personal favorite). Students often order directly from the restaurant's website, however, new users
                often find it challenging to navigate. This project will perform a heuristic analysis of Yan Cusine’s
                landing page and navigation and propose a new layout to allow better customers to explore the menu
                and order their meals more efficiently

                <h2>Key Project Structure </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heuristic Analysis </li>
                    <li>Accessibility Anaylsis</li>

                    <li>Responsive Website</li>
                </ul>

                <h2> Key Project Outcome </h2>
                A responsive, high-fidelity re-design of Yan's Cuisine online menu.

            <h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Current Yan's Site</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5%"> Shown below is the landing page/ordering page of Yan's main website. Using
                Nielsen Norman's Heuristics
                guidelines and static testing, I identified 3 main areas of concern with this current webpage. </p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Efficiency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Text is small and hard to parse effectively </li>
                <li>Store hours and pick-up are minimized </li>
                <li>Dishes are categorized too specificly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Learnability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Button CTAs are unclear in what they lead to </li>
                <li>Redundant information gives new users more information to parse through, irrelevant to their
                    main
                    goal</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Memorability</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Multiple CTAs indicate multiple flows to order food, which can lead to confusion for
                    returning users trying to remember how to interact with the website</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>W.A.V.E Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                In terms of accessibility, there is only one main error identified by the WAVE tool which is that
                the search button is lacking form labels, meaning those who are using certain accessibility devices
                may not be able to evaluate that specific element. In addition, another concern flagged by WAVE
                is the type size of all the dish categories, which are all presented on the webpage with fonts
                10px or smaller and could make it difficult for hard-of-sight users to parse through the menu.

            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                I first approached the challenge of redesigning Yan's online menu with two main issues in mind: the
                aforementioned usability findings, and to make the new design responsive
                across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. In particular, since the original website prioritized
                online ordering
                and menu parsing, I expanded the menu. <br>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src='portAssets/lowFiYans.png' alt='' />
                <figcaption>
                    <p>(<a href='portAssets/lowFiYans.png'>enlarge sketch</a>)</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> The original website prioritized online ordering and menu parsing, however the layout was too cramped to
                be effective, therefore I expanded the
                menu. Additionally, since Yan’s is pick-up only, other high-priority information would be not only the
                hours but also the location, which was highlighted in a sidebar. Lastly, because in the original
                website, clicking into a category would obscure other menu options, I opted to go with a horizontal
                tabbed menu for which there is a nested vertical scroll page -therefore you can both maintain your
                categorical location in the menu while also looking at specific items.</p>

            <h2>High-Fidelity</h2>
            <h3>Design System</h3>
            <p>
                I first appproched creating my hi-fi design by with creating a design system and base components
                identified in my lo-fi wireframe.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src='portAssets/designSystemYans.png' alt='' />

                    <p>(<a href='portAssets/designSystemYans.png'>enlarge sketch</a>)</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Completed Hi-Fi</h3>
            <p> After I created my design system, I built out the 3 main viewing ratios. Throughout this process, I also
                annotated the page with consideration of how sections would translate into html/css/javascript</p>
            <figure>
                <img src='portAssets/hiFiYans.png' alt='' />
                <figcaption>

            </figure>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Static HTML Webpage</h2>
            <p>Using html/css and the hi-fi Figma annotations, I coded the <a
                    href="https://roundthings.github.io/responsiveRedesign/">the final site </a>and launched it.</p>
