            allow user to easily heat up their food, including determining heating times and levels. </p>

                    RL is a frequent user off-meal plan who effectively and confidently interacts with the microwave
                    interface. They use a range of settings/buttons depending on the variety of items they are heating,
                    including frozen meals and lukewarm beverages. These buttons are limited to: time cook, express
                    time, add 30sec, stop, start and the open button. In particular, RL was sensitive to the remnants
                    left by previous users, such as noting there was extra time left in the timer and the microwave was
                    misaligned from being pushed back too hard.

                <p class="explained">
                    GB is an infrequent user on-meal plan who primarily uses the microwave to head up milk or other
                    beverages. They interacted with interface with some uncertainty, having to pause before choosing
                    their time option. In this case, they defaulted to settings that were familiar to them from their
                    home microwave, in particular the express settings. When using the microwave, they were
                    multitasking, making other parts of the coffee or checking their phone. They also occasionally
                    looked into the microwave to make sure their milk did not overflow and pushed the door-open button
                    before the timer reached zero (they did not clear the timer).

                    CE is user on-meal plan who uses the microwave sporadically for when they need to heat up leftovers
                    or takeouts. They initially clicked the door-open button and then when the door popped out, they
                    pushed the door open even more to then place in their bowl. CE confidently interacted with the
                    microwave settings, quickly selecting the time cook button and the number pad. They were quick to
                    open the microwave before the timer hit zero, expressing that they greatly disliked the finish
                    sound.

                    <p class="boxed">
                        1. Users all expressed being in “pilot mode” when they use the microwave, whether or not it was
                        part of their normal routine. <br>
                        2. Users first noticed the clock/timer when using the microwave, often checking for if there was
                        leftover time from the previous users. <br>
                        3. All users noted that they only really microwaved in 30sec intervals, up to 2 minutes unless
                        in a specific circumstance. <br>
                        4. In particular, user were unsure what the specific meal settings corresponded to and generally
                        avoided them. <br>
                        5. Users generally disliked seeing any time left on the microwave timer, finding it a chore to
                        clear before use. In addition, all the users tended to open the microwave before the timer hit
                        zero because they found the “ding” grating. <br>

                    Gabby is a college sophomore on the mandatory meal plan who loves to bake on the weekends. She often
                    uses the microwave at home but uses the one in her dorm room infrequently. Because of this, her
                    mental model of a microwave clashes with that of the dorm microwave interface. In addition, she is
                    not used to using a shared microwave and often gets disoriented from the leftover effects of other
                    students’ uses (uncleared timer, food stains, etc). Grace represents the portion of users that are
                    infrequent users of the dorm microwaves yet are used to the interface of the microwave at home, and
                    are unfamiliar with shared appliances.

                    Grace is a college senior who lives off-campus and is off meal plan. She meal preps frequently and
                    thus regularly uses the microwave in the break room to heat up her food. Grace is often in a rush
                    and can’t be bothered to watch her food, but cooks things with many different heating times so she
                    just undershoots how much time the meal will take to heat. In addition, she hates the sound of the
                    microwave going off and is confused the the different microwave settings. Grace represents the type
                    of users who are frequent and familar users of the dorm microwave who care about getting their food
                    quickly and efficiently, and have not bothered to spend time explore anything other than what they
                    initially learned.
