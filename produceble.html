            <h1>Case Overview</h1>
            <section>
                <p>
                <h2>My Role</h2>
                Team Leader, UI/UX designer
                <br>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                Sustainably-minded individuals have limited and inconsistent access to fresh, locally-sourced produce of
                different varieties in Rhode Island. On the other hand, local producers have limited funds and human
                resources to sell directly to consumers, and instead are forced to rely on middlemen who might not align
                with their interests. This project seeks to explore the different stakeholders in the New England Local
                produce market and define a potential system for farmers to easily set up direct-to-consumer sales
                avenues.

                <h2>Key Project Structure </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer segment identification </li>
                    <li>Customer discovery</li>
                    <li>Create a minimum viable product and low-fi wireframes</li>
                    <li>Conduct user testing with low-fi prototype</li>
                    <li>Create high fidelity prototype</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Key Research Questions </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the current state of New England Farming? Who are the stakeholders and what are their
                        priorities?</li>
                    <li>What do current sales avenues look like for local producers? What are the general barriers to
                        entry?</li>
                    <li>What are the current buying habits of households in the New England Region?</li>
                    <li>What are the structures of currently established CSAs (community-supported agriculture)?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Methodology & Tools</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Qualitative interviews ​​</li>
                    <li>Competitor analysis </li>
                    <li>Usability Test</li>
                    <li>Miro</li>
                    <li>Figma</li>
                </ul>


                <h2> Key Project Outcome </h2>
                A comprehensive high-level product navigation and use system and a high fidelity wireframe of the
                minimum viable product defined by market research.

            <h2>Exploratory User Research </h2>
            <p> We started this process by conducting secondary research and interviews with urban agriculture
                professors were used to create a rough outline of different customer segments for a direct-to-consumer
                produce sales platform. Then each member of the team identified a few individuals from each segment and
                conducted a 15-30 min exploratory interview, from which they were then referred to more potential
                contacts. Interview notes were then consolidated and analyzed together.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <h3>User Patterns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consumers purchase groceries as units (either families or roommates) </li>
                <li>Consumers lack consistent access to sustainable produce and goods </li>
                <li>Consumers primarily prioritize the freshness of goods and convenience</li>
                <li>Customers will pay more for locally-sourced products</li>
                <li>Small farmers find it extremely difficult to secure shelf space in regular grocery stores</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Pain Points</h3>
            <p>Consumers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High cost of fresh produce</li>
                <li>Low convenience and variety</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Farmers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High cost/risk to set up CSAs (direct-to-consumer distribution)</li>
                <li>Outpaced by large farms </li>
                <li>Restricted by retailers who demand high and consistent supply</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Creating a initial MVP</h2>
            <p> Based off of both market and user research, our team came together and brainstormed an initial product
                overview that addressed
                both the user pain points we identified and fit into the current market niche. We then finalized our
                problem/solution statement and market map (shown below).
            </p>

            <h3>Produceble is an online platform that helps small local farmers who want to sell their produce fairly by
                eliminating barriers to entry and connecting them directly to consumers whilst also helping local
                families and college students who want to easily purchase fresh, locally sourced produce by minimizing
                price and delivery time and providing them a convenient, accessible delivery option.</h3>

            <h2>Designing the Consumer Facing Interface</h2>
            <p>
                Based off of the product overview, Produceble would require two main sets of interfaces: the
                consumer-side and the seller-side. For this prototype, we wanted to prioritze the consumer side
                so we could do more specific user-testing down the line. Using the previous customer identification
                research, I conducted a focus group to nail down more specifc application features.

            </p>

            <figure>
                <h3>Prioritization Map</h3>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                After this exercise, I created several rough wireframes of a mobile display of Produceble.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <img src='portAssets/producebleWireframe.webp' alt='' />
                <figcaption>
                    <p>(<a href='portAssets/producebleWireframe.webp'>enlarge sketch</a>)</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Using these static frames, I then conducted a few user tests centered on the primary user flow, which is
                to find a farm, build your cart and check out. During these tests, I made notes about any points of
                friction the user may have experienced. These notes were then used to make changes to the final
                high-fidelity prototype.

            </figure>

            <p>
                To create the high-fidelity prototype (mobile format), I first created a design system with page,
                button, and icon variants that would be compliant with WCAG 3. Then I created the general layout and
                main
                features using my design system according to the architecture outlined and tested in the wireframe.
                After building out each frame, I started connecting frames via interactions.

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                I first approached the challenge of redesigning Yan's online menu with two main issues in mind: the
                aforementioned usability findings, and to make the new design responsive
                across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. In particular, since the original website prioritized
                online ordering
                and menu parsing, I expanded the menu. <br>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src='portAssets/lowFiYans.png' alt='' />
                <figcaption>
                    <p>(<a href='portAssets/lowFiYans.png'>enlarge sketch</a>)</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> The original website prioritized online ordering and menu parsing, however the layout was too cramped to
                be effective, therefore I expanded the
                menu. Additionally, since Yan’s is pick-up only, other high-priority information would be not only the
                hours but also the location, which was highlighted in a sidebar. Lastly, because in the original
                website, clicking into a category would obscure other menu options, I opted to go with a horizontal
                tabbed menu for which there is a nested vertical scroll page -therefore you can both maintain your
                categorical location in the menu while also looking at specific items.</p>
